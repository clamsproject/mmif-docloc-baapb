This plugin finds the location of AAPB files in the Brandeis Housing server for the purpose of resolving the 'baapb' scheme in MMIF document.location. //
The plugin requires mmif-python >= 1.0.2 and an external server to run https://github.com/clamsproject/aapb-brandeis-datahousing. The environment variable BAAPB_RESOLVER_ADDRESS should store the address where the server is running.
