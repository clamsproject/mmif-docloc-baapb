This plugin finds the location of AAPB files in the Brandeis Housing server for the purpose of resolving the 'baapb' scheme in MMIF document.location.
The OS environmental variable RESOLVER_ADDRESS should store the location where the corresponding web server, (https://github.com/clamsproject/aapb-brandeis-datahousing) is running.
